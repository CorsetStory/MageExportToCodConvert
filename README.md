# MageExportToCodConvert
Converts Magento Export to Cash on Delivery Format

This is a simple piece of code which reads an export file created by WebShopApps export extension and converts the file
into a format that can be read by MRW who process our cash on delivery service.

The code reads in the file in Western Latin 1 format and saves in UTF8.

I am sure the code can be reused for any number of file translations if you don't want to edit Magento...
